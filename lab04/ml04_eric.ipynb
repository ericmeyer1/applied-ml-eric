    "- **Did Case 1 overfit or underfit? Explain:**\n",
    "  - Underfit -- Very low R² on both train and test sets means the model does not capture meaningful variance in fare.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Did Case 2 overfit or underfit? Explain:**\n",
    "  - Undefit -- Low R² suggests it’s not a strong predictor. The close train/test scores indicate a weak but consistent model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Did Case 3 overfit or underfit? Explain:**\n",
    "  - Slight Underfit -- The test R² (0.0498) is lower than train R² (0.0735), meaning the model might be slightly underfitting but still doesn’t explain much variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Did Case 4 overfit or underfit? Explain:**\n",
    "  - Well Balanced -- Train R² (0.3089) and test R² (0.3166) are close, meaning the model generalizes well to unseen data. No clear signs of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adding Age**\n",
    "  - **Did adding age improve the model:**\n",
    "    - Yes but not a lot\n",
    "  - **Propose a possible explanation:**\n",
    "    - Age alone doesn’t have a strong correlation with fare because ticket price is likely influenced by class, destination, and purchasing power rather than just age.\n",
    "    - Older passengers may have had more resources to buy expensive tickets, but this pattern isn’t strong enough alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Worst**\n",
    "  - **Which case performed worst?**\n",
    "    - Age only\n",
    "    - R² is nearly zero, meaning it barely explains fare variability.\n",
    "    - The lowest R² values for both train (0.0099) and test (0.0034).\n",
    "    - Since the relationship between age and fare is weak, adding more data would not likely improve the predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best**\n",
    "  - **Which case was best?**\n",
    "    - Age + Pclass\n",
    "    - Highest R² (train: 0.3089, test: 0.3166), meaning it captures more variance in fare.\n",
    "    - The highest test R² (0.3166) and the lowest RMSE (31.44) indicate better predictive performance.\n",
    "    - Since the model is already generalizing well, adding more data might marginally improve accuracy but not drastically. A better approach would be adding more relevant features (e.g., embarkation point, ticket type)."

    "    - **Case 2:** Showed extreme bias toward Class 0, with nearly perfect recall for Class 0 but failed to identify Class 1 effectively.\n",
