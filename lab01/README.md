### **Machine Learning Project: Predicting Housing Prices with Linear Regression**  
**Author**: Eric Meyer

**Objective**: Build a linear regression model to predict California house prices based on key features.

#### **Project Overview**  
In this project, we use the **California Housing Dataset** to predict house prices based on **Median Income** and **Average Rooms**. We apply **Linear Regression** to understand the relationship between these features and house prices.

#### **Key Steps**
1. Data Exploration & Visualization
2. Feature Selection: Median Income & Average Rooms
3. Train/Test Split (80% Train, 20% Test)
4. Model Training: Linear Regression
5. Model Evaluation: R², MAE, RMSE

---

#### **Results**

- **R²**: 0.46 (The model explains 46% of the variance)
- **MAE**: 0.62 (Mean absolute error)
- **RMSE**: 0.84 (Root mean squared error)

These metrics suggest the model fits the data reasonably well, though there is still room for improvement.
